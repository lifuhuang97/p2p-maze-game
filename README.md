## Disclaimer
This is a school project done by a team of 3 students

The original git repository for this project is set to private by the school so this is just a clone

Credit goes to the entire team I was primarily in charge of functionalities relating to communications within the game via web sockets


## About the project
In this project we built a Java-based multiplayer game with a JavaFX GUI as a distributed system.

The game is built to handle approximately 50 users in a 15x15 grid. These players will move around asynchronously in the grid to "eat" points that spawn randomly in the grid.

The game is built with expectations that it can handle multiple concurrent user actions as well as stay online even if the players acting as the primary or backup server crash or disconnect.

### Built With
* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html)
* [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/usage.html)
